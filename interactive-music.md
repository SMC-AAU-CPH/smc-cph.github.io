The blog posts of this section relate to the course [SMC4054 Interactive Music Systems](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imv/SMC4054/) (2022 onwards) and to the discontinued course [SMC4045 Interactive Music Systems](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imv/SMC4045) (2019 to 2021). The aim of these courses is to develop knowledge of and practical experience with the design and implementation of systems intended for real-time sonic or musical interaction. This could be in the form of a performance-oriented musical instrument, or in various types of interactive sonic systems that explore collaborative physical, or virtual music-making. This section also includes posts from the *Physical Computing* and *Human-Computer Interaction* modules of the discontinued course [SMC4000 Introduction to Music, Communication and Technology](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419143616/https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/SMC4000) (from 2018 to 2020).
