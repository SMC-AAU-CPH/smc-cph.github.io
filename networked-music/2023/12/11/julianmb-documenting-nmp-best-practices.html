<p>At its simplest, a <strong>networked music performance (NMP)</strong> is a musical performance done in real time over a computer network. It enables people to be in two different locations and perform and practice music together synchronously as if they were in the same room. NMPs can connect musicians who would not usually be able to play together, help researchers gain insight into technology and performance interactions, and make concerts more accessible to audiences.</p>

<p>A crucial part of any NMP is documentation. Firstly, for audience members. It is important to ensure every audience member in any location has adequate “documentation” of the parts of the performance they are not physically in the room to see. Secondly, there are considerations to consider if you will document an NMP for academic purposes so that your evidence supports answering your research questions.</p>

<p>If you are an SMC student or a person completing an NMP in an academic setting, you will likely have to consider these factors when deciding the best ways to document your NMP. This blog post will provide tips, tricks, and best practices for documenting NMP for physical audiences, digital audiences, and academic purposes.</p>

<p><em>At the Aalborg University, SMC students use LoLa, a low latency, high-quality audio and video system, to host multiple NMPs each term. Within the current constraints of technology in 2023, at UiO, we can host NMPs using LoLa from two locations, with one camera feed sent from each site. This blog post is written with these technological limitations in mind so future SMC students can use it as they plan and host NMPs.</em></p>

<h2 id="general-tips">General Tips</h2>

<p><strong>1. Make a technical diagram (or a few!)</strong></p>

<p>Making at least one technical diagram is vital to planning and hosting a successful NMP. You can do this on a free and easy-to-use website, <a href="https://app.diagrams.net">draw.io.</a></p>

<p>No matter what software, hardware, locations, or performers you are using, a technical diagram can help you gain clarity from the start about what equipment you need, how many people need to be at each location, where the best places to set cameras may be, etc. It can also help you foresee any documentation challenges that may come up. For example, will you need an extra laptop and camera feed to record the performance? A technical diagram lets you prioritize your documentation needs from the beginning.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a technical diagram SMC’s 2023 cohort made for their first autumn 2023 NMP.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/SMC-master/blog/assets/image/2023_12_11_julianmb_tech-diagram.png?alt=original" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p><strong>2. Ask for consent</strong></p>

<p>Before beginning documentation, especially if the concert is live-streamed or data from it is used for academic purposes, ask all people participating if they are okay with being photographed, recorded, and interviewed. Doing this before the performance can help you plan your documentation of the concert and any data you will collect during it. For example, if you know some performers don’t want to be interviewed or recorded, you can plan ahead and shift your methods.</p>

<p><strong>3. Take Photos</strong></p>

<p>Through set-up, rehearsal, and during the performance, assign a technician to take photos. Often, in research-based contexts, it is helpful to have pictures of where any cameras are placed, where people are standing, and where other equipment is in relation to performers. These photos can then be used in reports to aid in explaining specific elements of the event.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/SMC-master/blog/assets/image/2023_12_11_julianmb_nmp-photo-example.jpeg?alt=original" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example photo from the 2023 cohort’s second autumn NMP.</em></p>

<h2 id="multiple-audiences">Multiple audiences</h2>

<p><strong>1. Consider camera placement in each location</strong></p>

<p>This point explicitly concerns LoLa, where we currently can only send one camera feed to another location. Ensure both audiences can see all performers on the projector screen and in the room. It is helpful to test this during the setup of the concert. Make sure there is enough time left to adjust if needed.</p>

<p><strong>2. Consider extra cameras or software you may need</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you are testing a specific research variable. In that case, you may need a LoLa camera in one location to show a particular angle of one location. However, the angle you use for your research might not be the best for the audience at the other location.</p>

<p>Consider if you need an extra laptop or USB camera (and of what quality) to send a more appropriate view for the audience to a projector screen through Zoom. Then, performers can see the lowest latency and specifically angled view on a gaming monitor separately. Drawing a technical diagram and including documentation software and hardware can help prepare for this situation.</p>

<h2 id="online-audiences">Online audiences</h2>

<p>One benefit to NMPs is that they can easily be accessible to digital audience members. You can easily live stream NMPs with a bit of planning. <strong>Open Broadcasters Software (OBS)</strong> is a free application that allows you to arrange multiple camera feeds to live stream on Twitch or YouTube. Again, this should be considered beforehand as it could require an additional computer, software, and cameras at both locations. Having a technician to set up, check, and run the stream will also be important.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about OBS, check out their <a href="https://obsproject.com/kb/quick-start-guide">Quick Start Guide</a>. Additionally, OBS can be used to stream to social media platforms, opening up options to share NMP on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter). If you are interested in using OBS to stream to social media check out <a href="https://godreamcast.com/blog/solution/live-streaming-and-webcasting/obs-studio-live-streaming/">Dreamcast’s guide</a> on using OBS to stream across platforms. Facebook also has created their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/497386444253763">own guide</a> for using OBS to stream to Facebook Live.</p>

<h2 id="academic-purposes">Academic Purposes</h2>

<p>There are a few key things to consider when documenting a NMP for academic purposes. This year’s SMC students have found it helpful to rely on some of the concepts present in phenomenological research. Phenomenological research is a qualitative research approach that seeks to explain things by exploring people’s lived experiences of phenomena. For example, it can explore connections between musicians during performance and rehearsal. Here are a few things you should consider when documenting an NMP for academic purposes:</p>

<p><strong>1. Video and Audio Recording</strong></p>

<p>Taking an extra camera to record a wider angle of the entire performance in all locations can be helpful. Using a field recorder to record all the audio could also be beneficial. Later, you can look back at these recordings by yourself, with performers, or audience members and identify moments that stood out or that you would like to gain more insight into.</p>

<p><strong>2. Observational Notes</strong></p>

<p>During the planning, set up, performance, and after an NMP, it is beneficial to make observational notes about your experience. You could carry a small notebook and a pen, record short voice notes on your phone, or take notes on a notes app for a phone or tablet. As starting points, you could focus on how you feel, conversations you notice happening, and decisions you see being made. Try not to jump to justifications for what is happening, but focus on recording what is happening and the feelings surrounding it.</p>

<p><strong>3. Interviews</strong></p>

<p>Interviews can be crucial for gaining more in-depth knowledge about the experiences of performers, technicians, and audience members. Consider who you would like to interview for your specific research variables and remember to get their contact information. When interviewing, it may be helpful to take a semi-structured approach where you come into the interview with a list of topics and questions you have. Then, during the interview, you can ask clarifying questions or discuss any issues. No matter what approach you take, it will likely be important for you to ask open-ended questions.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.amberscript.com/en/blog/open-ended-questions-in-qualitative-research/">Amberscript’s guide</a> as a starting place to learn more about open-ended questions and the interview process.</p>

<p>Documenting NMPs requires planning, good communication. Prioritizing good documentation at all stages of a NMP, particularly in the planning stage, can lead to a better audience experience, more academic possibilities, and reflection that will help create better NMPs in the future. Happy documenting, and good luck with your next networked music performance!</p>
