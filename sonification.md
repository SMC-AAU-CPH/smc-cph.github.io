The blog posts of this section relate to the _Sonification_ module in the course [SMC4001 Introduction to Music, Communication and Technology](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imv/SMC4001/) (from 2022) and to the discontinued course [SMC4046 Sonification and Sound Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20210518095718/https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/SMC4046) (2019 to 2021). The aim of the course is to develop knowledge of and practical experience with sonification, including sound design, interface implementation and perceptual analysis. The interface design process extends from requirements in the problem domain to evaluation of the auditory display.
