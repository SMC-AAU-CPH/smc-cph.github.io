Being an SMC student can be an overwhelming experience, especially at the beginning. You are required to use several new software tools and online environments from the beginning.

In light of this, we have prepared a collection of [guides](https://github.com/SMC-master/Guides/wiki) featuring step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, general tips and other valuable information on a range of topics designed to make the SMC experience as smooth as possible. We therefore recommend students go through each guide and do eventual preparatory work before starting the programme, or to access these guides later on when necessary.
