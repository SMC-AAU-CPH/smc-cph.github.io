# Team U
SMC’s 2023 students, Tom, Karenina and Juliana, have all had strong backgrounds in music from an early age. Playing cello, singing and being a part of various music groups have defined large portions of their lives. 

Within the past five years each of the three members have gravitated towards various aspects of music technology. Working in live sound, with Max and experimenting with electronic music composition and performance have drawn them each to SMC to explore music technology more deeply. You can meet each of them below:

## Karenina Juarez

Hi there! My name is Karenina and I am from Los Angeles, CA, USA. For my Bachelor’s degree I attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. There I discovered my passion for the convergence of music, technology, and visuals. I graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Music majoring in Electronic Production and sound design with a minor in Music Technology. During the pandemic, I interned at Tesla where is was taught valuable AV skills that helped me in my AV career. I have since worked at Harvard and MIT as an AV supervisor and AV and Events Associate respectively.

In this program, I want to sharpen my skills in programming and go more into depth of my studies of machine learning and music computing.

Outside of music I like to swim, crochet, travel, read, and meet awesome new people!
