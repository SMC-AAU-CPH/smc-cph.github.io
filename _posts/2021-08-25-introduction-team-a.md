# A-Team

## Introduction

Hi, we are the A team! Not as in the Ed Sheeran song but as cool as the TV show! The A-team is a diverse team exploring various aspects of sound such as music, acoustic or soundscape analysis. We’re all from different parts of Europe and have come together from Norway, France, Scotland/Germany and Spain. We are a passionate and funny team (to varying degrees of success) who are looking forward to taking on the challenges at the SMC.

Read our individual sections to get an idea of what to expect from us in the forthcoming months!

Hi!
My name is Sofía and I come all the way from Spain because I was given the opportunity to dive into the musical and technological field, two areas in which I have always been interested. I’m a **singer** who’s never had a band and I had to find my way around sound editing programs in order to make my own songs and covers. After that, I became very interested in learning more of this side of music, so I think I found my place at the SMC.
As for my formation, I have been in the **conservatory** for four years playing violin (but that was a looong time ago), I have a degree on **English Studies** and two years of **singing lessons**. That’s why I hope to learn as much as I’m allowed here in the SMC but also as much as my brain is able to take in without exploding…
Besides the academic details, in my free time I enjoy just about anything that’s **creative**: watching movies/TV shows, playing videogames, creative writing, drawing, baking (and eating the baked goods), singing, writing songs…you name it.

### Joachim Poutaraud

Joachim studied a Bachelor in Archaeology & History of Art and worked as an assistant engineer for the soundscape archaeology research project [Bretez : sound heritage enhancement](https://www.msh-lse.fr/projets/bretez/) directed by musicologist Mylène Pardoen. Furthermore, he was engaged as a member of the [Acoustic Task Force](https://notre-dame-de-paris.culture.gouv.fr/fr/acoustique), directed by acoustician Brian F. G. Katz and musicologist Mylène Pardoen in order to propose several acoustic models for the reconstruction of the cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris. His interests are related to soundscape studies, acoustic ecology and ecoacoutics and he hopes to be able to develop an interesting project in relation with the technological contributions of the SMC Master program.

Hugh studied a Bachelor in Sound and Music Production in Germany. However, his interests lie anywhere and everywhere there is something to learn (even if this learning is a slow process). Nonetheless, the through line is how all of these different areas can be related to music, his biggest passion, with Hugh having played piano and bass in many different ensembles over the course of his life. It’s the multidisciplinary character and the cutting edge aspects of the SMC program that really appealed to Hugh, and he hopes to be able to develop as a musician, a technologist, and a person over the course of the next two years.

Some examples of his work include:

- [Sound Installation 'Extrude' exhibited in Darmstadt, Germany](https://youtu.be/7E5Ckih0YoY)
- [Recording and mix of the piece 'Interlude for Trombone' performed by the Landes Jugend Jazz Orchester Hessen](https://soundcloud.com/hugh-von-arnim/interlude-for-trombone/s-PJ2WohHHl4C)
- [Composition of the piece 'Lost Time'](https://soundcloud.com/hugh-von-arnim/lost-time/s-2l1gKjCodV0)
