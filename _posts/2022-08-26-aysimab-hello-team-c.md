# Who are we?

The members of Team C all share the ambition of really getting out of our individual comfort zones as we work our way through the SMC programme! We came together with quite diverse academic and professional backgrounds, but quickly found that there is a lot of common ground between us at various levels. We look forward to collaborating, learning, sharing and hopefully creating a lot of great things together over the coming two years!

Have a look at our individual sections below to learn more about each of us.

As a whole, we see Team C as having a set of complimentary skillsets.  While Aysima and Olve have backgrounds in computer science and engineering respectively, Fabian and Alex have backgrounds more centred around music and production.  This complimentary combination of skills has already proved fruitful, with Team C competing and achieving second place in the C2HO opening hackathon.

My name is Alexander Wastnidge and my background is in Music Production, Audio Engineering and Education.  As a music producer I have been a signed artist under the moniker “From Beyond” since 2018.  I have also been involved in creating music for picture, AV and other projects.  As an audio engineer I have been a freelance recording, mixing and mastering engineer for music and online content working mostly with independent artists, labels, podcasters and film makers.

I also have seven year’s experience of working in creative education teaching everything from DAW music production, audio engineering and film sound.  The intersections of personal creativity with the wider spheres of technology and society is an area of great interest to me which I look forward to exploring in this course.

Hello! I am Aysima and I am a Software Engineer with a bachelor degree in Mathematical Engineering. I graduated ten years ago and have been working on cloud systems as a full stack developer. In the last three years, my role has been developing services for an online meeting platform which focuses on hybrid and remote meeting solutions, therefore I am interested in learning how hybrid and remote setups can work for music performances. 
        
I have been playing accordion and learning different dances for some years. Music and performance arts have been something I tried to pursuit for a long time but I think I lacked dicipline and focus in order to be productive at those two areas. 

I know programming but I have no idea about sound, electronics and even music. I am seeing this programme as an oportunity to learn from others and produce solutions which brings programming, hybrid communication and music together.

Hello! I'm Fabian. I got Bachelor in Musicology from the University of Oslo specializing in music philosophy. My thesis explored the relationship between popular music and nostalgia, looking at different ways the past is used to todays music and how it affects our thoughts and feelings about the future. I have a passion for music production and (old) electronic music which naturally led me to the SMC program. What interests me in particular is getting a deeper understanding of the tools used in production and the interactivity between humans and computers. In my spare time I play bass in the band Ushikawa.

Hi! My name is Olve. For more than 20 years I have been working in the international maritime and offshore energy sector with engineering, business development, project management and corporate leadership, but have now reached a point in life where I want to take a timeout to follow my long-running dream of dedicating myself full-time to music related activities, and see where that may take me!

Despite my relatively long-running corporate career my greatest passion (apart from my children and wife) is music, which I have been doing in one form or another for most of my life. I learned basic skills and music theory in my childhood and early youth by taking lessons and playing the clarinet and classical guitar, and later I moved on to electrical guitar (and eventually also singing) which I have been doing since.

I am Norwegian and live just outside Oslo with my wife, our two teenagers and a labrador retriever. By way of education I have a MSc degree in Engineering from the NTNU technical university in Trondheim, and have also done 1-year full time programme in Music Production and Recording at the University of Stavanger.

The integrated musical and technological nature of the SMC programme stands for me as a great way to combine my passion for music with my technical education and work experience, and I am really looking forward to it!
