**Creative festival goers** need **an interactive and low-stakes way to create and collaborate** because **it can provide a relaxing reprieve from the festival while still being engaging.**

Some kind of interactive art piece. I\'m thinking similar to those big
photos that everyone who comes in at an event like a wedding can sign,
but instead of signatures they can leave some kind of audio/visual
input. Would contain some kind of adaptable controller to interface
with, with the potential to be remapped for different individual use
setups on the fly. Could make extensive use of physical models for audio
input controls and ML for mappings?
