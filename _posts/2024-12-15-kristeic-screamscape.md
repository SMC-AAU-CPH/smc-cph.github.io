### Visit [the audio examples page](https://juanalonso.github.io/ddsp_fm/) to listen to the results.

DDSP-FM is a fork of the [official DDSP library](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp). This version includes the following new features:

* a differentiable 4-op FM synthesizer
* a differentiable AM synthesizer
* a new operator, `mult`
* a new TFRecord, suitable for future develpments, such as preset matching
* a flag for stopping the training if losses are NaN
