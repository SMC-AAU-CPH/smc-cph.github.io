excerpt: Blind/visually impaired festival goers need an easy way to get information about things near them because it can enable a more autonomous experience for them.

I do not know if Roskilde already has something like this, but project would develop some kind of device similar to audio guides used in museums. In such a high noise environment, could be a physical device with a braille grid that displays words based on what the user is nearby using some kind of sensor or geo-marker. Could also have some sort of audio/earphone component as well. Perhaps similar to this exhibit at the Bauhaus museum: https://www.studiokamp.com/bauhaus-sound.

Could also include some kind of vibrational feedback similar to this projectÂ https://www.notimpossible.com/projects/music-not-impossible for deaf/hearing impaired.
