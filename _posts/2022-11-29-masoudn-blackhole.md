## Blackhole

BlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency. As a newly migrated user from Windows to Mac I found Blackhole, pretty reliable, easy to use, and easy to map between platforms, So I decided to share the features and make an installation and user guide! Enjoy!

- Supports 2 , 16 , and 64audio channels.
- Customizable to 256+ channels if you think your computer can handle it.
- Supports 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz, and 192kHz sample rates.
- No additional driver latency. BlackHole is also available using brew cask install blackhole

## Benefits:

- Stable working with no crashes (Also on Apple Silicon)
- Different versions available for specific needs
