A sculpture, inspired by [George Koutsouris](https://georgekoutsouris.com "Artist homepage") and [Takis](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/takis-6-musicales "Artist homepage") creates a harmonious soundscape that transports listeners to a state of zen. As visitors interact with the sculpture, gentle sounds reminiscent of nature---such as rustling leaves, flowing water, strings vibrating and soft chimes---emerge, fostering a meditative atmosphere. The installation not only serves as a visual and auditory delight but also as a sanctuary for mindfulness, inviting individuals to pause, breathe, and reconnect with their inner peace. It is designed to reduce overstimulation to population with ADHD and other disorders.

### Haptic Vibration API for Weather Translation

This innovative project aims to bridge the gap between weather conditions and the visually impaired community through the use of haptic vibrations and sound. By developing an API that translates real-time weather data into tactile and auditory signals, users can experience weather changes in a unique and accessible way. For instance, the sensation of wind might be conveyed through gentle vibrations accompanied by the sound of chimes, while rain could be represented by a rhythmic tapping and the sound of droplets. This system not only enhances accessibility but also enriches the sensory experience, allowing users to perceive and interact with their environment in a meaningful manner.
