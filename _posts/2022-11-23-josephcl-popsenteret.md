# Introduction

The term “music production” means many different things to different people. For some, it conjures an image of a person talking a band through the process of the album they’re recording. Others might imagine a teenager hunched over a computer working on an electronic track. But what are the commonalities that unite these figures and how can this be present interactively to the public? This is the question we were tasked with answering by [Popsenteret](https://www.popsenteret.no/), the museum for Norwegian popular music. 

# FUZZ

One of the museum’s interactive experiences is the FUZZ exhibit. This presents various musical instruments to visitors, offering an overview of how they function and showcasing how to recreate several sounds. Currently there are four different stations which present the guitar, bass, drum-kit, and synthesiser.

Our job was to create a fifth station: music production. Since there aren’t instrument commonly associated with music production, we instead explored creative nature of music production.  

# Our Station

   <figcaption>Our final solution for the FUZZ music producer station</figcaption>
</figure>

Our station is intended to be a collaborative experience, operated by four visitors simultaneously. Each visitor controls a separate section, and together they produce music. 

## Station Sections

### Sequencer

<figure style="float: none">
   <img src="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/SMC-master/blog/assets/image/2022_11_23_josephcl_pic4.jpg"  width="70%" height="70%" />
   <figcaption>The station's sequencer section, which uses computer vision to detect if a hole is covered</figcaption>
</figure>

A sequencer allows users to create a musical pattern, typically rhythmic or melodic. While sequencers are usually presented on a computer screen or small electronic device, we decided to go big. 

<figure style="float: none">
   <img src="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/SMC-master/blog/assets/image/2022_11_23_josephcl_pic5.jpg"  width="auto" />
   <figcaption>Other common sequencers available on the market</figcaption>
</figure>

Each of the rows represents a separate instrument, and each column represents a step in time. The sequencer loops through the steps and plays back a sound if the instrument is active.

<figure style="float: none">

</figure>

But the sequencer needs some sounds to play, and this is where the next two stations come into play. 

### Drum Pad

<figure style="float: none">

   <figcaption>The drum pad section of the station</figcaption>
</figure>

Each drum pad represents a different drum sound, which are played back by the bottom four rows of the sequencer. When a drum pad is hit, its sound changes. A hard hit makes it sound louder and reverberant, a soft hit makes it quiet and clean.

The visitor can also play along to the rhythmic sequence in real time. 

### Deconstructed Guitar

   <figcaption>The deconstructed guitar section of the station</figcaption>
</figure>

The noises from the guitar are sampled played back by the fifth row of the sequencer. We decided to present the guitar slightly differently by deconstructing it into three separate components: the neck, strings, and body. 

<figure style="float: none">
   <img src="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/SMC-master/blog/assets/image/2022_11_23_josephcl_pic8.jpg"  width="auto" />

   <figcaption>Right: The guitar body with a kick pedal next to it to encourage users to hit it</figcaption>
</figure>

Instead of playing the guitar as normal, the user can interact with these components by scraping along the neck, plucking a string, hitting the body with a kick drum pedal, or any other way that they can imagine!

### MIDI Keyboard

   <figcaption>The MIDI keyboard section of the station</figcaption>
</figure>

The visitor at the keyboard section does something a little different. On top of the rhythmic sequencer the station also has a melodic sequencer. This is represented by a row of eight blocks on the screen. 

<figure style="float: none">
   <img src="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/SMC-master/blog/assets/image/2022_11_23_josephcl_pic12.png"  width="70%" height="70%" />
   <figcaption>The interactive melodic sequence view, which is featured on the station's center touch screen in front of the MIDI keyboard section</figcaption>
</figure>

Each block represents the same step in time as the rhythmic sequencer, and the position of the block determines the pitch of the note in the melody. The keyboard player creates this sequence on the touchscreen. Then then can press a keyboard key and play back the sequence in the specified key.

## Genres

Before they start using the station, the visitors pick a genre that they want to recreate. The selected genre determines the sound of the drums and the synthesizer controlled by the two sequencers. It also turns several lights above holes on the rhythmic sequencer red. These holes represent a common rhythmic pattern for the genre.

</figure>

By moving the Popsenteret logo around the above grid, the visitors can control two effects. The X-axis controls the pitch of the drums, and the Y-axis controls an echo effect.
